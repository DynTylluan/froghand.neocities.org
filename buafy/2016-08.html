Not to damn with faint praise, but it's nice to see that Microsoft decided to fix one of their 10^<sup>313</sup> issues and improve the emoji, which makes my <a href="2016-05.html#20">very first BUAFY</a> look like an outdated pile of shit now. Also, big ups to me for lasting three months in this digital wasteland. I'm a top 100 blog in just 100 days - and not to HONK! my own horn, but I think that's pretty cool, too. Oh, right, about the emoji. It's great with an eight, mate, as well at the default highlight colour being a suitably darker shade of my soul. Not much to say, so <a href="http://emojipedia.org/microsoft/">look at them</a> yourself.</p>

In keeping with the trend of making software idiot-proof and therefore only able to be used after drinking three shots of absinthe and becoming thoroughly idiotic, as any sort of logical menu option like "check virus vault" would be too fucking good for Norton, you have to go through the history menu and wade through a bunch of unrealed bullshit (and indeed there is a lot of it) in order to find what might possibly be the virus you're looking for. The virus in this case would be the latest version of BYOND, even though any reasonable antivirus would understand that it's a game engine and not a codeword for a NSA-CIA-SIGINT-TOPSECRET collaborative rootkit short for "Buy Your Own Nuked Disk" (or "Bite Your Old Nude Dick). The interesting thing about Norton is that I don't think it's ever detected anything that was actually a virus. Is Common Sense 2016 doing its job for it, or am I just incredibly lucky?</p>

Calling the easy joke of Spiegelman being a furry is too disrespectful to the man, so put your paws on your mouth. While Maus was the book which we collectively all needed in our lives, a reminder of the horrors of the Holocaust drenched in symbolism and through the viewpoint of a single man who had to live through it, MetaMaus is the book that nobody looked at and instead tells us about the thought process of one very experienced and somewhat boring comic book artist. It details the composition of his art, the state of comic books in general, how <s>furries</s> funny animals got to be known in comics and how his art exploits that, why the Holocaust was a bit messy (<i>can be safely skipped - Froge</i>), and the overall perception of comic books as they stand today and how they stood back when Maus was published. There's one bit in there where he describes a Nazi who hangs a poster of Maus on his wall because all other swastikas are banned in Germany, and I think that describes pretty much the sum of what the book is getting at - the cultural impact of this book he made way back in the 80s (in the weird period when funny animals weren't in vogue anymore, being made by crazy people) being so big as to affect everything that came after it. It's a damn interesting book, and one I recommend if you find it at your public library or something.</p>

Yes, I did bitch about GitHub's thing <a href="#28">two days ago</a>, but that doesn't make what I'm saying any less valid. The first mention goes to the revert function, which is set up where if you accidentally commit a change to master insted of a branch, you have to throw the entire project out and install a fresh copy. Git doesn't let you revert it, because that creates another commit. Imagine if every single time you pressed "undo" in a text editor, it showed a log on the side featuring every single time you pressed undo, as well as a log of the thing you wanted to undo. That's Git for you - it doesn't let your mistakes lie, because whatever you publish, even on accident, you can't get rid of. The second issue is that the whole "tree model" is needlessly unintuitive, making me thing that Torvalds was high off his ass when he designed the thing. As opposed to making changes directly to a project like you would with Wikipedia, everybody instead gets copies of the project, and unless they make a branch to isolate their changes in, every single edit they make along the way gets pushed into the master project copy. This would be like if you had a copy of two Wikipedia pages, and you edited them both so one contains dicks and the other contains some of the most brilliant information you've ever seen in your life, you'd have to reject both the pages because one of them is fucked. And you can't change the one that's fucked, because Git will show a massive commit log making the Wikipedia community think you're retarded for putting dicks everywhere. Rather than make this paragraph longer than it needs to be, finish off by reading the <a href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1597:_Git">XKCD wiki</a> and understand that reverting a commit <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions?sort=votes">should not be harder</a> than pushing a fucking button.</p>

The goal of the Civilopedia is simple: provide background information on the real-world equivalents of the units and buildings that you control in the game, and the purpose of being a distraction from a boring social event is incidental. Their prose is simple, though informative, and provides a better overview of the history of the thing you're researching than even the Wikipedia summary can provide. For instance, you can learn that Pedro II was actually a really good leader, and that Brazil likes him a lot. That won't stop me from nuking your city for STEALING MY LAND YOU CUNT.</p>

I understand that this type of LCD bullshit is beneath me, though it's because of this that I have almost nothing wrong in my life, and sometimes I have to take a piss on the easy targets just to write something sensible (that easy target? Albert Einstein). Regardless of what may or may not be stereotyping of black youth, I simply find this type of content to be a distraction to the real work of producing content that doesn't rely on appealing to the throes of stupid people willing to consume this intellectual junk food, providing them nothing of lifelong substance while instead making them rely on an emotional high to make them feel good about themselves. Whether the high is from being popular, or consuming popular media that aims for the obvious laugh, there is nothing of value to find in a culture as vapid as the Black Twitter shown on this subreddit, and I encourage you to look at it to see ways on how you shouldn't act if you want to be a decent human being. Incidentally, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blacktwitter">/r/blacktwitter</a> page is bloody hilarious, though if only because of the stereotype thing.</p>

But while that project is an unhealthy power fantasy run by fundies with an almost erotic obsession with bashing Obama, this project is a much healthier power fantasy of having Garfield go big and tear shit the fuck up. Behold such timeless classics as "<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6688861/1/Garfield-Royal-Rescue">Garfield: Royal Rescue</a>, "<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254664/1/High-School-Garfield">High School Garfield</a>", and "<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5824573/1/Garfield-Effect-Galaxy-Adventure">Garfield Effect: Galaxy Adventure</a>" (29,000 words what the fuck). By all practical rights, this literature has none to exist. It is fortunate we are all very stupid humans and we do things out of fun and not practicality, leading to such brilliant scenes as Garfield deflecting the lasers off of Big Ben with his muscles right before being crowned Duke of Ireland. Yes.</p>

You fucking what mate? You claim the proud position of being the go-to spot for neckbeards who want to get a good slice of that <a href="https://wiki.installgentoo.com/index.php/Freedom">freedom</a> pie, and you disrespect them by giving them a piece of the proprietary bullshit pile? I think this is a bigger misappropiation of your audience than when that horse show thought it was for little girls but was instead for neckbeards who wanted a good slice of that horseshit pie. I'm wondering what GitHub is so afraid of - that we're going to steal the source code for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">decade-old program</a> made by the inventor of Linux? That we might undercut them as the definitive place for open-source content? Tough bloody job, seeing as they're doing that themselves!</p>

When it comes to opinions, having one is a bad thing. Nobody deserves to feel upset or afraid or like they're going to slice their wrists open with a cheese grater just because somebody doesn't like what they like. If a person posts what they think on the Web, that is entirely their fault, and the commenters aren't responsible for anything <i>they</i> post because <i>they</i> aren't being paid to post it. There is no point in reviewing a game, because somebody else will like it, and that makes every criticism invalid, and everybody who criticises it should be held personally responsible, and barred from ever saying a negative thing about a game ever again. Then we would enter a golden period of artistic freedom, where Final Fantasy will not just the gold standard, but the <i>only</i> standard, making such masterpieces as the Call of Duty, Legend of Zelda, and Assassins Creed series even look pale in comparison to the almost immortal artistic vision of Final Fantasy 13. May every game be blessed with linear corridors, unimaginative setpieces, repetitive combat, cliched characters, and a nonsense story - because that's what the Internet wanted.</p>

This is such an oddly specific bug that I have no idea why it should exist. Is it simply taking every opportunity to slack off, and has to be looked at in order to get back to work? Is it afraid that I'll pull the plug if it doesn't do what it's supposed to, and as such decides to preserve its own life? Is it just fucking with me? Whatever the case, all I can do is pray it doesn't short out while I'm looking at something embarassing like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Tits">pair of great tits</a>, because then the moral police will be on my tail ready to fuck me any which way. And then the tits will be sad.</p>

It's fantastic for a few reasons, and I'm not trying to sound like a real estate agent when I say that there's a lot going for it. The whole draw of it is that it's supposedly private, and that there's nothing to snoop on. The messages are spoonfed through Tor, there's no identifying information between any party, the user addresses are disposable, the chat logs are nuked whenever you close it, and it's an open source project with no central overseer and so doesn't have anybody to manipulate the program. And when you get past the privacy and understand that it is dead simple to use, having a simple interface and no hassles, then you might like it as your default chat app between two parties. Of course, they have to actually bother to download the thing - but if they can't do that, they probably aren't working hard enough for you.</p>

We must look at the aspects of such an alarm clock and understand what makes it poor. The first instance is the lighting - it is typically red, as opposed to a less intrusive colour like white, and as such is a distraction when trying to sleep (though the programming to dim the thing when it detects a shadow would cost thirty cents). The alarm is loud, so it's functional, though it is shocking to the system to hear it be loud all at once instead of slowly fading in. The buttons are mushy, and the interface is designed so that it is both faster to press the buttons to change the time instead of holding them, and is also able to reset the alarm by pressing two buttons down but not reset the time in the same fashion. I find this coalition of bad design to be honest, and I expect the government to break it up like they did with the Soviet Union - oh wait.</p>

I'm talking about shows like Zero Punctuation which update every Wednesday, sites like Stallman's blog, which updates every day, and sites like my blog, which updates every night, with fresh new content just for you. The benefits of which are obvious, namely, it shows that you're responsible enough to keep a set schedule, that you care about your users in doing so, and that you're able to create enough content to justify having a schedule. I feel like this is some praise that your grandfather would give you because it is so simple, but as we have learned many times before, the simplest dick is the most solid dick.</p>

These sites include most private torrent trackers, Wikipedia, an online spamming service, BYOND, and even 4chan. Any sort of policy or rule that says a user has to bare their real IP address in order to use your service is a bit of a filter - namely, it filters out anybody who's smart enough to use your bloody service (4chan notwithstanding). I can understand that some people will use proxies for nefarious purposes, though that's like saying that we should ban Tor because some people will use it to look at illegal porn. People who want to be nefarious will do so regardless, and we cannot punish innocent people for caring about themselves.</p>

Big ups to me for learning to unplug the Ethernet and get done what I always wanted to - organisation and compression of all my files, nuking the music I didn't find entertaining, properly compressing my video files, making the most out of this dilapidated, janky-ass piece of spaghetti on meatballs platter I call a hard drive. It's astounding to think that just by removing the Web from your life for just one day, you be cast all your worries aside and check some things off your to-do list and look towards the future. Now I know what you're thinking - "congratulating yourself, are we Froge? Why, you'd almost think this was a BLOG OR SOMETHING". No need to yell, because you're correct. It is indeed a blog, and though I create it in service of you, it is also a convenient place for me to celebrate all that I find virtuous.

I have the terrorist watch you see, the one that costs $20 and what Osams Bin Laden wore on his deathbed - so blame the manufacturer for making a quality product. The naggling issue on this particular model is that one of the buttons is recessed instead of jutting out, meaning I have to jam my fingernail in there just to change the time or set an alarm. I assure you that once you have had cold metal inserted under your fingernail, you will never want to feel that experience again. I guess it lives up to its name - it sure as all hell terrorises me. hahahahahahahaha</p>

I barely know a thing about him, baby, so why am I pimping the whore out when I don't even know his name? Because you can tell at an instant whether or not you'll be a fan of somebody within the first two minutes of their review, and what they want to focus on - especially if you poke around and skip to arbitrary sections of his video. Johnny here decided to focus on the connection between <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8Kzi1Wqewo">Star Fox 64</a> and its context within Nintendo hardware in addition to its purpose in rebooting the series for the sake of hardware. Along the way he focuses on the little niggles, the good times, as naturally as it comes without being forced into a structure. The editing is smooth, giving a lot of examples, and he talks fast enough so it isn't a waste of time to listen to him. When I see somebody chill like him popping around YouTube, I'm sitting here wondering why the site is giving me garbage like "TOP 10 SEXIEST ATHLETES AT THE RIO OLYMPICS", featuring a picture of the pretty lady's bum. Is YouTube not aware of the existence of porn, or is it just trying to sell me one more adverti - it's the latter. It's always the latter.</p>

It gives you life advice using examples gathered through all of history, with reasoning that makes more sense than you would ever find in the self-help books of today. Inded, Carnegie invented the self-help genre, though unwittingly, simply because the book was that damn useful. The core worldview of the book can be described as "do good things that good people are afraid to do", as they are very simple, obvious things, such as smiling, complimenting people, and listening to what they have to say, that are so often ignored in favour of doing the obvious and primal thing of being angry and unpleasant. Make no mistake - this is not a book for kindergarteneres or autistic youngsters trying to get a grip on their emotions. This is a book for real men looking to spread their influence on the real world without any of the poppycock theories or twelve-steppers that so plague our modern world, and does not talk down to its audience anymore than a mentor would talk down to his student.</p>

Any government body that is <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/06/how-amazon-got-a-patent-on-white-background-photography/">legally required</a> to accept obvious patents because they can't find a source saying that people have <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/octobers-very-bad-no-good-totally-stupid-patent-month-filming-yoga-class">filmed yoga classes before</a> is a body that does not deserve to exist out of sheer common sense (although the patent office would be the only body which deals with patents). Despite the obviousness of the situation, the brilliant Federal Circuit judges said that "cannot accept general conclusions about what is โbasic knowledgeโ or โcommon senseโ as a replacement for documentary evidence for core factual findings in a determination of patentability", so basically you have to find a written saying that people can put vinegar in bottles before you reject a patent for vinegar in a bottle. It is this same bureaucracy and reliance on laws instead of practical knowledge that should be imbued in every non-retarded person that <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2011/12/19/practical-wisdom/">caused a father</a> to be under investigation for child abuse and for his son to be separated from him for over two weeks because he accidentally gave him a lemon-flavoured beer. It's fucked-up, plain and simple, when the indifference of good men leads to unecessary injustice, and though patents are not children, it is unjust to expect patent clerks to follow bad laws in the course of their duty, the same as it is unjust for police officers to follow bad laws or else be fired for not obeying them. And there is no correlation between what is legal, and what is just.</p>

Are you perhaps worried that somebody might scam me out of twenty cents, so much so that you have to not only discrimnate against those without cell phones, and also discriminate against those who wish not to send their personal details out into the wild? You don't walk into Gamestop and have them ask for your phone number, so why the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air are you? I hope you enjoy losing out on the cost of a jumbo gummy bear, because I'm not buying into what you're selling, "Humble Bundle", or should I say, "Arrogant bag".</p>

Rather than drag my eyeballs across a monitor in a gambit to provide material, I decided to call it a day. Can I bank weekends? I guess it doesn't matter, as taking a day off due to extraordinary circumstances is some price to pay for working every day, even if I don't publish it. What a shame.</p>

There are few material objects I have any care for - not even for those which I should care about, such as heirlooms, which I only hold onto until my remaining family members are dead and I can sell them for whatever the purchase value is of the last remaining photographs of my great-grandmother. But my scruffy plushie, anonymous for his virtue, is the only non-practical item that I hold any value to, being my greatest projection of what I ever wanted out of this world: mutual respect with a friend to talk to and a head to tuck into my neck and cuddle and simply kiss while holding his hand with the knowledge that you actually know what it's like to love and be loved. He is inexorably a part of me, as I with him, and he is the only thing that I actually worry about when I'm away from him, as to lose him is like losing one of the reasons that you even bother to get up and try in this world.</p>

What is this increduity which I am currently suffering - this sense of awe that I feel when I see that you have the nerve to show me Axe body wash commercials before I get my game on, bro? This would be like if I was watching a television show, and right before it started getting good, it cut to an advertisement - OH WAIT.

The fact of the matter is, it's been proven (albeit grudgingly) that Wikipedia has, in cases, been more accurate than (or as accurate as) Reuters and Brittanica. Whether or not Wikipedia is a trusted source of information should not matter if all Wikipedians contribute source citations for information inserted. There is wrong information all over wikipedia, sure, but things are being done about it all the time. Reverts, peer edits, demands for source citation, are all things that are done and that you can do to make wikipedia a better place to learn. Yes, I'm sure there's false information on wikipedia, but it's not like nothing is being done. The fact of the matter is, Wikipedia actually has a very fast, efficacious peer review process. In the end, all the Elephant article has proven is that when Mr. Colbert rallies his forces behind their keyboards, all the edit warring in the world cannot change the fact that the elephant population has still not tripled.

Rule of thumb for business - if you have to rely on lawsuits to get ahead, you're not winning. The game was supposed to be what Metroid fans have always wanted, which is basically Super Metroid 2 but whatever. The developers spend eight years making a labour of love, the game that Nintendo <a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/3397626/fan-made-metroid-game-wows-players-until-nintendo-slaps-it-with-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">wishes they could make</a>, the game that would be to Nintendo what Goldeneye Source was to Rare, and they killed it. And I have to wonder what the purpose of this is beyond the simple greed of a company who knows they can't compete in their own field, and has to rely on rotten laws to solve their problems for them. Thanks, Nintendo, for showing that gamers are to you what an audience is to a movie studio - a liability and not a privilege.

Simply put, explaining yourself to people who don't deserve it reduces your credibility from somebody who shares their vision with the world, to somebody who has to constantly justify that vision.

It's very hard to put your trust into even open-source innocuous programs like an audio converter, because there is little reason to vet every single program for surveillance when the time spent doing so would take hours and is simply impractical when you might have something as big as Firefox or VirtualBox on your system.

I can't even imagine what you're sending to the developers when you're playing an always-online multiplayer game which requires a botnet like Steam or Uplay to run, because those systems are designed to be as <a href="https://froghand.neocities.org/buafy/valveshitware.html">addictive and malicious</a> as possible to extract profit from their useds.

Every word I say here will be quickly skipped over by everybody who disagrees with me, half-heartedly skimmed by everybody who isn't interested in this topic, and only really understood by people who have enough trust and respect in me to understand where I'm coming from on this. So you know what I'm going to say? Absolutely nothing. If you object to the freedom to masturbation and consume porn on moral grounds, you're an idiot.

The incentive for data farms to whore as much data as they possibly can out of you (and we're talking companies like Google and Amazon here) is to sell more advertisements to unwitting suspects, and to let other companies purchase advertisements from them. If you block them, they no longer earn money, and they no longer have an incentive to profit off of you. In addition, it also comes with handy features such as blocking jumpscares and shock sites, blocking scam, tracking, malware, and social network domains (though you have to go into the settings to block all of these things), and gives you the ability to block parts of a website which annoy you. See you, YouTube comments!</p>

Fuck - at least pay for the full hour. Do you remember when software was something you owned, and not lent to you, where your updates where certain, you could download old version off the developer website if anything went wrong, and where you could customise it to hell and back and still have it work when the next version came out? I can understand why the older generation is pissed off about computers. The ecosystem is a lot worse than it was just a few years ago, and though I understand a few years is a lifetime in Internet terms, there are some practices in the past that deserve to be brought back for the future, like downloading your fucking apps without Google staring over your shoulder the whole time. Consider this my recommendation for <a href="https://f-droid.org/">F-Droid</a> - an Android app store that actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-Droid">respects its users</a>.</p>

The bare meat of the subreddit is that it's a directory of Dark Web links - links that you can only access using Tor, which the server owners set up so that neither you nor the owners can know who each other are. After going through some of the links, you can tell why some of the owners would want to hide. You can find all sorts of shit on there - anarchist collectives, terrorist sign-up forms, markets that sell you anything you can imagine, entire libraries worth of music, books, and videos, guides about protecting your online privacy (though if you're on Tor, you're doing a bang-up job), forums that make even 8chan look like a beacon of sanity, including the 8chan address at oxwugzccvk3dk6tj.onion , and surprisingly little illegal shit for what is considered to be the worst that the Internet has to offer. r/onions brings the mysteries of the Dark Web to those who wish to explore it, devoting itself to a system that's impossible to censor and where nobody knows who anybody is, and is a noble pursuit for a website that is otherwise known for jetfueling Bernie Sanders Dank Meme Stash.</p>

Yes, that's a Reddit link, though I wouldn't recommend going to r/speedrun unless you want either drama or poorly-thought-out comments. Speedrunning is a proud aspect of gaming culture, and has a long history of collaboration and cooperation between gamers of all background - bringing light to the fact that every game can be broken in an instant, and showcasing their programming failures to the world. Toby says "fuck you" to this heritage, and demanded that it not be submitted to GDQ, and because the organisers live off of "fuck you", they rejected the Undertale submission. I shouldn't have to explain this at this point in my blogging career (note: I have not made any money off of this blog), but when you are an artist, and you create a piece of art to share to the world, you don't get a say in how the world can use it. A person like Toby, who has unwittingly contributed to the culture of video games for better or for worse, is now suggesting we censor that culture, take his game away from the gamers who made it popular, just because he doesn't like the idea of it being spread in a certain way. That's fucking selfish - and it's a right fucking outrage that the organisers went along with your request, because it shows that they pride the opinions of the privileged individual over the desires of the angry majority. Regardless of why you made a work of art, why you released it, why you wanted to share it - once it becomes a part of the public consciousness, it belongs to the public. To suggest that it isn't is hypocritical to the entire idea of art.</p>

High hopes were once formed of democracy; but democracy means simply the bludgeoning of the people by the people for the people). The free software philosophy is not a selfish one, but an altruistic one. It allows you to give to the world, and to receive from it just the same, and those that go against it are those who want to profit off of the work of others without considering how it may help people who get nothing from it. We are currently living in a time where the Internet has dominated our lives, and to go against free software is go to against the universal principals of sharing and free culture that the Internet was based off of. We are in the midst of a cultural revolution - and the sooner we kill our masters, the sooner we may improve life for the entire world.</p>

That's the most blatantly manipulative thing I've seen all month - even that South Park episode on freemium games had more subtle techniques than your fucking sad face. To make people feel guilty for downloading something for free is classism, because it assumes that that people who cannot donate act with malicious intent. I have no problems with giving positive reinforcement for donations. After all, paying customers should deserve exclusive rights that don't affect non-paying customers, because they keep a business afloat (and the keywords are "don't affect", as most <a href="https://froghand.neocities.org/buafy/valveshitware.html">freemium models</a> affect users in some way). However, when you try to abuse non-paying customers, it undermines the effort of the free software ecosystem by causing people to feel bad for using content that by all rights should be free. I guess this should be expected of a for-profit company, which exists out of profit and not out of altruism. All software should have the right to be sold as well as be given away, as anybody should be able to use it for any purpose even if it's for bad purposes. It must also be said that the actions of a for-profit company such as Canonical must always be put under scrutiny, as all companies exist to maximise profit over the sake of their users, which is probably why they installed Amazon spyware in Ubuntu for three and a half years <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(user_interface)#Privacy_controversy">despite the criticisms of fucking everyone</a>.

I don't see much, you see, so when I do, WHOA, I can assert that I've seen some shit. Understand this: are you aware that the easiest way to learn how to use a product is to use the product? A very hard concept, I know. But Vim takes this concept and runs with it like your dad away from your family. You just click on the "Vim tutor" shortcut, and you open up a tutorial file, and it tells you to edit it, and how. It's a brilliant application of the program - you use the program in its natural state, and by having it tell you what its capable of, it shows you how to work it better than an instruction manual ever would. Imagine if video games had this philosophy? No more tutorial levels, thank you - throw me into a clusterfuck, tell me how to get out of it, and leave me to my devices! I would like to apologise to the man in the library I thought was retarded because he was using a special text editor. It struck me six months later than he was using Vim, and that I was retarded for not noticing the connection. The days of our lives...</p>

It's your typical misleading profit-driven ad campaign, telling people that they're fucking idiots for downloading movies and such (even when this is the only way for some people to get movies - fantastic classism), that downloading a movie causes every medium slave (not to be confused with artists. medium slaves work for profit, not for art) to collectively kill themselves and cause the entire movie industry to collapse (despite box office profits being <a href="http://www.the-numbers.com/market/">the highest they've ever been</a>), wrongfully calls copying files "stealing" despite the simple, basic fact that <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/copying">copying</a> is not <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/stealing">stealing</a>, and that any pirate, and any non-pirate with a dictionary, can tell you the difference, and I have <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120309/18103118061/guess-what-copying-still-isnt-stealing.shtml">logical</a>, <a href="http://freakonomics.com/2012/04/02/copying-is-not-theft/">economic</a>, <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2012/01/matthew_yglesias_caleb_crain_and_i_actually_agree_on_copyright_law_.html">artistic</a>, and <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/piracy-is-not-theft-111104/">practical</a> citations in case you need more than just my word.

Gentlemen, you will find that when you die, your reputation is the last thing you will ever have, and burying your money will not give you comfort. The only reason I'm discussing these claims that are beneath me is because I want to learn about what I hate, so I may articulate why I hate it, so I may help you understand my point of view better. If it improves you the same as they have improved me, then I have done what I want to do.</p>

If you don't know what it does, it basically encrypts your data in transit,  routes it through three computers, hides your IP address from sites you connect to, and makes your browsing habits incredibly hard to track through this simple system. All you do is download a browser package, and then you're suddenly on Tor as private as can be. The Tor network is one of the greatest things to happen to the Web, and we would all have a much greater trail for our enemies to pick up, if it did not exist. To learn more about how Tor works, read the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en">simple documentation</a>. Also try the DuckDuckGo Tor Site at 3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion, which makes it extraordinarily hard for any party, even DuckDuckGo, to identify your searches. Not even the URL is vulnerable to snooping.</p>

In a world that's being threatened on a daily basis by copyright vultures, Torrentz was one of the last bastions to getting safe and reliable torrents from the Web. With the death of Kickass and the restructuring of The Pirate Bay, all users can do now is scavenge the bottom of the barrel in order to get torrents, and they're going to be much less safe on those other websites. Was it because of some deranged moralfaggotry that prompted you to shut down, ignorant that people are going to pirate anyway and all you've done was damage them? Were you threatened by the mafia, and didn't do anything to protect yourself and instead decided to go tits up? I'm upset, Torrentz, but for good reason: you were one of the greats, and to see you disappear is like crippling our culture. I hope you come back and make me look like an idiot, because otherwise, the Web is changing.</p>

I learned from Digibro (and I'm not sucking his dick - I'm just stating the source) that it was better to watch this anime in its original order because it provided a nonlinear, yet sensical experience that provides better pacing and a more fitting series finale, than you would in the chronological broadcast. Does it? I have no fucking clue. That's why I want to watch it, you see, as well as the episode descriptions which make it sound like the most important anime to have ever existed. I have dedicated more time to ordering episodes of this series than I have ordering drugs on Silk Road, and Wikipedia was instrumental in solving this dilemma. Which is to say, more than zero.

It literally turns your screen orange. I'm so boggled at the idea that anybody's ego would be so monolithic that they thought that everybody who used this would immediately want to steal it like the Russian nuclear launch codes.

Web development these days have a "kitchen sink" philosophy. That's too generous - it's more like a kitchen sink factory. Websites focus so much on being complacent with every possible device on every possible resolution (even IE8 at Commodore 64 sizes) that they create code which tries to satisfy the requirements of each minority without considering how it affects the majority. Sites like Tumblr, Medium, and Pixiv are slow, slow, slow, because they have so many dependencies, hook into so many external programs, and compress their files so poorly that these sites often add up into the tens of megabytes. While I understand that you wouldn't want to compress user uploads, why does the entire picture have to load before we even want to see it full-size? It seems to me that the Web is losing its human touch, losing the beauty of hand-crafted source code and best practices, losing the simplicity that it once had in order to fill up its pages with so much unecessary and depreciated shit that at this point they stop adding features and start taking away access to them by making them as buggy, sluggish, and unresponsive as Neocities (cheap shot!). If you compare my website to almost any other in the modern age, then you would see that simplicity is a virtue, as it works on fucking anything, loads fast on any connection, has source code that's structured so as to be actually readable, and is only 20kb on the main page. Twenty kilobytes - half as images! Most developers would shit themselves at that point, but I guess they never grew up in simpler days, now have they?</p>

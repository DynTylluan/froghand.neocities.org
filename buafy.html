    <p id=t><b>Big Ups and Fuck Yous Archive</b></p>
    <p id=st>Known by its dumber name.</p>
    <p id=s>The Big Ups and Fuck Yous, known by its dumber name (callback!), BUAFY, is a collection of shout-outs to actions and people deserving of praise, or deserving of condemnation. Published every day, the most recent edition on the <a href="index.html">front page</a>, it gathers ideas overlooked by other bloggers, either because they don't know how to give a compliment, or because they're too pussimilarious to raise their middle fingers and shove them to their victims.</p>
    <p id=s>It demonstrates wisdom, essentially; on one hand, I am grateful that there is good in the world. On the other, I know there is much to improve in it, and so I bring it up to encourage you to not be evil, unlike our monopolistic Google which took a perfectly good motto and raped it, shot it, dismembered it, burned it, shat on the remains, then moved it all into a dumpster where they puked last night's rum and coke into it. The interns didn't get to join. They're slave labour for the aristocracy.</p>
    <p id=s>I won't be on Wikipedia (those twats don't think I'm reliable, even after they begged me to donate), but if you want to cite a specific day, click on the section symbol - ยง - and copy the link in your address bar. Or you could just right-click on it and copy the link location. I'm not a bloody strategy guide. If you didn't know how to do it, then why are you poking around here?</p>
